# My Unicode 20/21 solutions

Unicode 20/21 is a online coding competition where 80+ UK based universities and a separate Europe team compete against each other in a number of challanges. The contestants have options to code every challange in a different language and the options are great.

The contest consists of 13 challanges over the course of 7 months and at the end when a team finishes in the top 5 of their league they earn a place at the ultimate coding battle finale.

## My write ups

The solutions that can be found here are solely mine and they are not perfect, but it gives me a great platform to sharpen my coding and problem solving skills.

## Folder structure

Every challange lies in a folder of it's own with a `challange.md` file containing the challange it self and a `solution.[ext]` file which contains my solution in the language of choice.
